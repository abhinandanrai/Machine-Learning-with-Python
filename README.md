# Machine-Learning-with-Python

### Libraries 
Required libraries to run all Jupyter Notebooks are as follows:

* NumPy
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

# Project 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Motivation
The goal of this project is to predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics.

### File Description
Download the files from this repo which is available in the Datasets folder in .csv format or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

The Jupyter notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python and survival prediction using LogisticRegression, and RandomForestClassifier on Kaggle Titanic dataset.

# Project 2. HR Analytics Using IBM HR Dataset

### Motivation
The goal of this project is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition.

### File Description
Download the file from this repo which is available in the Datasets folder in .csv format or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

The Jupyter Notebook goes through the Kaggle IBM HR Dataset via Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) with Python and finishes with building machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier.
