# Project 1. HR Analytics Using IBM HR Dataset

### Motivation
The goal of this project is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition.

### File Description
Download the file from this repo which is available in the Datasets folder in .csv format or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

There is also a Jupyter notebook which goes through the Kaggle IBM HR Dataset via Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) with Python and finishes with building machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier.

### Libraries 
Required libraries to run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook are as follows:

* NumPy
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
