# Project 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Motivation
The goal of this project is to predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics.

### File Description
The file is in the Dataset folder in .csv format as 

The Jupyter notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python and survival prediction using LogisticRegression, and RandomForestClassifier on Kaggle Titanic dataset.

Download the dataset from this repo or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Project 1. HR Analytics Using IBM HR Dataset

The Jupyter Notebook goes through the Kaggle IBM HR Dataset via Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) with Python and finishes with building machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier.

You can download the dataset from this repo or [directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
